# Repo Sustainability Lab

A data-driven system for estimating **maintenance debt and stagnation risk**
in open-source GitHub repositories using public event data.

## What this is
This project models repository health over time, focusing on:
- activity decay
- responsiveness
- contributor concentration

It does **not** rank popularity or code quality.

## Data
Uses public GitHub event data (GH Archive via BigQuery).
No private data is collected.

## Status
🚧 Setup and data pipeline in progress.
